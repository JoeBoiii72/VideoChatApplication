/**
TO DO
**/

/**
Efficient and effective way of creating packets with both audio and video.
This could include compression, which we'd then have to write code for.
Packet header, sequence number etc.
**/

/**
If we do use compression. Create method for taking in a Image and creating a compressed
byte array that we can send via udp. Do the same for audio.
**/

/**
Set up peer to peer connection, with ability to diconnected and connect using three way handshake.
Maybe use TCP for this. We need a to create a simple super loop for the sender and reciever to deal with
different packet types.
**/

/**
Implement GUI for this.
